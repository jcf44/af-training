  description: Industrial equipment detection for mining and construction operations
  use_cases:
    - Mining site monitoring
    - Equipment tracking
    - Safety zone enforcement
    - Productivity analysis
  recommended_model_size: s  # YOLOv8s, equipment is large and distinct
  target_precision: fp16  # FP16 for balance
  
# Data sources:
# - Roboflow construction datasets
# - Custom annotation required (most mining equipment)
# - COCO construction subset
# - Site-specific footage annotation

# Tips for annotation:
# - Include various distances/angles
# - Day and night conditions
# - Different weather (dust, rain)
# - Partial occlusions
