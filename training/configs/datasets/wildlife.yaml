  description: Wildlife detection for camera trap monitoring and conservation
  use_cases:
    - Camera trap analysis
    - Wildlife corridor monitoring
    - Conservation research
    - Human-wildlife conflict detection
  recommended_model_size: m  # YOLOv8m for better accuracy on small/distant animals
  target_precision: fp16  # Accuracy important for species identification
  
# Recommended data sources:
# - Microsoft MegaDetector (pre-trained on camera trap data)
# - LILA BC (Labeled Information Library of Alexandria)
# - iNaturalist dataset
# - Snapshot Serengeti
# - Custom camera trap footage

# Note: Consider using MegaDetector as a first-stage detector
# (detects animal/person/vehicle) then use custom species classifier
